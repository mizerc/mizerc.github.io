I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer based in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle"&gt;Seattle, WA&lt;/a&gt; with extensive experience in fullstack development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hold a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Engineering from the &lt;a href="https://www.ufrgs.br/site/"&gt;Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, with an international education program in Computer Science at the &lt;a href="https://www.wisc.edu/"&gt;University of Wisconsin, USA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Occasionally, I explore areas like computer graphics, physic engines, compilers, and electronics. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### About the content of posts
The "posts" section is a growing collection of notes on a variety of random topics I'm exploring.
It might sound a bit confusing, as this isn't exactly a portfolio to showcase my professional skills, nor is it a personal blog.
I think the real reason behind it is that I'm practicing writing and creation of public content.
So any topic I find out interesting can be a potential new post.
Since this is the beginning of my journey, some posts may contain errors or rough ideas.
So, thank you for your patience and understanding.
I tend to revisit these subjects from time to time, adding new thoughts, findings, or questions as I continue to explore them.
If you have questions, comments or spot any errors, please write me an email at [contact@mauricioize.dev](mailto:contact@mauricioize.dev). --&gt;
&lt;!-- I have a genuine curiosity about how things works under the hood, and as a hobby of mine I enjoy building things from scratch.
If not in a professional environment, I believe that trying to inventing the wheel is a great way to truly understand the challenges and steps necessary to build things we grant for free.
I will try to document some of the process in this space. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Stay curious, keep building, and share. --&gt;</description></item><item><title>Recipes</title><link>https://mizerc.github.io/wiki/recipes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mizerc.github.io/wiki/recipes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tags</title><link>https://mizerc.github.io/tags/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mizerc.github.io/tags/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
